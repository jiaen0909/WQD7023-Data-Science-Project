## Course Information
Name: WQD7023 Data Science Project

Title: Analysis of Consumer Complaints Through Machine Learning Approach

Summary: A data science project with the objective to uncover the main issues in CFPB complaints by topic modelling, and predict the urgency of the complaints based on the complaints expressed sentiment by supervised machine learning models. The dataset was downloaded from CFPB complaints database. As it was a unlabelled dataset, lexicon-based approach was applied to label the sentiment-based urgency of the complaints by computing their VADER score. In the end of this project, it was found that SVM outperformed the other models with the highest accuracy and F1-score.
